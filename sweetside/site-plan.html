        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            We started our family-owned business in March of 2023 as a means to help me as a 17-year-old save money for college.  The vision for the initial business changed multiple times as we figured out where we best fit.   We learned that in order to sell online we would have to get a commercial kitchen so instead we started with events and then approached brick-and-mortar stores and locations to sell there. We did pop-up events in local coffee shops and sold on social media. We started in a couple of boutiques and music stores but eventually found our niche.  We are now located in six different stores across the Phoenix metropolitan area. We encourage people to shop local and support small businesses.
