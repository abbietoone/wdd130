                <h2></h2>
                <p>We started our family-owned business in March of 2023 as a means to help me as a 17-year-old save
                    money for college. The vision for the initial business changed multiple times as we figured out
                    where we best fit. We learned that in order to sell online we would have to get a commercial kitchen
                    so instead we started with events and then approached brick-and-mortar stores and locations to sell
                    there. We did pop-up events in local coffee shops and sold on social media. We started in a couple
                    of boutiques and music stores but eventually found our niche. We are now located in six different
                    stores across the Phoenix metropolitan area. We encourage people to shop local and support small
                    businesses.</p>

            <section>The all-time fan favorite is the original flavors of Skittles. We also carry wildberry and sour
                skiddles. The runner-up flavor is the nerdy clusters, these are freeze-dried gummy nerds. It should be
                gummy candy with a crunch on the inside becomes a very fluffy treat. Be warned, the products are very
                delicious!
