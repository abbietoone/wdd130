            <p> We started our family-owned business in March of 2023 as a means to help me as a 17-year-old save
                money for college. The vision for the initial business changed multiple times as we figured out
                where we best fit. We learned that in order to sell online we would have to get a commercial
                kitchen
                so instead we started with events and then approached brick-and-mortar stores and locations to
                sell
                there. We did pop-up events in local coffee shops and sold on social media. We started in a
                couple
                of boutiques and music stores but eventually found our niche. We are now located in six
                different
                stores across the Phoenix metropolitan area. We encourage people to shop local and support small
                businesses.</p>

            <p>The all-time fan favorite is the original flavors of Skittles. We also carry wildberry and sour
                skiddles. The runner-up flavor is the nerdy clusters, these are freeze-dried gummy nerds. It
                should be
                gummy candy with a crunch on the inside becomes a very fluffy treat. Be warned, the products are
                very
                delicious!</p>

            <p>If you have a freeze dryer be sure to check out our recipes below to try to make this product for
                yourself!</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Set machine to "High Temperature Candy Mode". To acheive the perfect crunchy airy texture do
                    not
                    add extra top plastic layers. This will prevent them from overheating. Warm Trays at
                    150-degrees
                    for 8 min and Freeze Dry at 150-degrees for 3hrs. Remove from machine shortly after cycle is
                    complete before the machine has cooled. This allows the skiddles to maintain their shine.
                </p>
                <p>Note: This recipie can also be used for Sour and Berry SKiddles as well as Sweet Tart Chews!
                    Additional dry time may be needed in more humid climates in order to completely dry the
                    candy.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Gummies Recipie</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Set machine to "High Temperature Candy Mode". You should not need to add extra top layers,
                    but if
                    your gummies come out flat this is an indication that they did not warm enough and will need
                    to
                    have the extra plastic layers. Skip warming trays. Freeze Dry at 150-degrees for 10hrs.
                    Remove
                    from machine shortly after cycle is complete before the machine has cooled. This prevents
                    the
                    gummies from becoming sticky.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p> Before freeze drying cut 1 taffy into 4 equal peices, do this to all the taffy that you
                    intend
                    to freeze-dry. Be aware that the taffy becomes sticky and can stick together so space
                    appropriately. Set machine to "High Temperature Candy Mode". To acheive the perfect crunchy
                    airy
                    texture do not add extra top plastic layers. This will prevent them from overheating and
                    melting. Skip warming trays and Freeze Dry at 150-degrees for 3hrs. Remove from machine
                    shortly

                </p>
                <p>Note: Additional dry time may be needed in more humid climates in order to completely dry the
                    candy. If candy is not puffing this means that it is not getting warm enough in the
                    beggining.
                    Adjust recipie and try incrasing or adding time to the warm trays cycle or add the extra
                    plactic
                    on top to increase convection.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Jollys</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p> Before freeze drying cut 1 taffy into 3 equal peices, do this to all the jolly ranchers that
                    you intend
                    to freeze-dry. Be aware that the taffy becomes sticky and can stick together so space
                    appropriately. Set machine to "High Temperature Candy Mode". To acheive the perfect crunchy
                    airy
                    texture add extra top plastic layers. This will help them become warm enough. Skip warming
                    trays and Freeze Dry at 150-degrees for 4hrs. Remove from machine shortly
                    after cycle is complete before the machine has cooled. This prevents jollys from becoming
                    sticky due to the cold temperature that the machine will settle into after the cycle.
