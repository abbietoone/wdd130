  <h2>Abigail Toone</h2>
  <p>Hello all!  My name is Abigail Toone. I am a concurrent enrollment student in my senior year of high school taking 12 credits this semester through BYUI. I live in Buckeye Arizona where our summer weather lasts 6 months, and for 3 of those months it is on average a pleasant 112°F. I have been raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and come from a family of seven. I am the oldest of 5 kids. I enjoy being outdoors and learning new things. This summer I discovered that I enjoy traveling! I was so blessed to go and experience Austria and Germany with my mother.  It was my 1st time going out of the country and I am excited to continue going on adventures!</p>

  <p>Another passion of mine is entrepreneurship.  I currently run a small business where I sell freeze-dried candy locally.  My products can be found in 5 stores across the Phoenix metropolitan area.  Starting a business I learned how to do so many new things! In this class, I hope to learn additional skills that will further my future entrepreneurial endeavors as websites are essential to all E-commerce.</p>

<p>I currently hope to pursue a bachelor's degree in Interdisciplinary Studies; studying various aspects of entrepreneurship, with classes that vary from accounting to web design! In Doctrine and Covenants 6:15 the Lord explains, “Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth;” I believe that the spirit is the greatest teacher and that with His help we can learn anything. As President Russell M. Nelson has taught us, “Education is the difference between wishing you could help other people and being able to help them.” I am looking forward to all I will learn in this class and the opportunities that await.</p>
